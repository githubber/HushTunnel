Hush Tunnel: SSH Tunneling add-on for Firefox

As we become more and more engaged online, our lives are transforming into the very information that is the fabric of digital space. Whenever we access a web page, send an email, share a file, our information travels through cyberspace and bounces off an untold number machines before it arrives at its destination. That information is sampled at light speeds during its journey by automated data mining programs running on behalf of our local internet service providers, advertising agencies, and big brother all with their own agendas. Though most of us have a reasonable expectation of privacy, in reality our most private communication with friends, family and work are commonly exposed when conducted over the internet.

While technologies such as SSL that are meant to encrypt our sensitive traffic offer fair protection from theft, they do not perform very well when protecting our privacy and ensuring our anonymity according to recent reports.

And beyond traditional HTTPS, most services that promise to encrypt and anonymize our traffic using SSL VPNs are based on the very same technology which relies on a middle man to provide the key for encryption. It is has long been known that entities, such as governments, are provisioned with master keys by certificate authorities to decrypt any traffic they choose.

The problem is that, for the corporations that control governments, the domination of the global information we produce and consume is an opportunity too lucrative to pass up. They understand all too well that there are only so many times that we will stand together SOPA-style before losing interest in a drawn-out online battle for privacy that constantly demands our attention.

What we can do is protect our own privacy at the individual level, making hard for a man in the middle to eavesdrop on our communications. One well known method to do this is using a technique called SSH tunneling, that guarantees a reasonable level of privacy through an anonymous key-agreement protocol providing perfect forward secrecy. Unfortunately SSH tunneling can be a bit hard to setup for the non-technical public and even cumbersome to maintain for the technical. Furthermore, most SSH tunneling services out there offer insufficient total monthly data transfer making them impractical for day to day use.

Hush Tunnel provides an extremely user friendly interface to tunneling traffic through SSH so that anyone and everyone can use it. Simply click the icon, the lock is green, and your traffic is encrypted. Click it again, the lock is grayed out, and your traffic is back in the clear. Not only does Hush Tunnel keep your data private with strong encryption, it also automatically punches a hole through any firewall, meaning no more blocked websites and services for users who may need to bypass censorship. Though we recommend the HushTunnel.com tunneling service due to ease of setup, the highest monthly data transfer (3x higher than the next highest service), complete anonymity, and to generally support Hush Tunnel we designed the Hush Tunnel add-on to work with any SSH tunneling provider you choose.
